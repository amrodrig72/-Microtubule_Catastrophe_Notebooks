# -Microtubule_Catastrophe_Notebooks

This repository uses the micro_cata package version 0.0.1 developed by Andres Rodriguez (amrodrig@caltech.edu) and Adiel Perez (afperez@caltech.edu) to analyze the microtubule time to catastrophe data acquired from Gardner, Zanic and coworkers (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037).
